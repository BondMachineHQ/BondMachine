# BM Builder

BM Builder is a library that generates a BondMachine architecture file from a set of already existing BondMachines by combining them. BM Builder is a tool that is part of the BondMachine toolchain. It works by layering the BondMachines on top of each other, and then combining them into a single BondMachine. It is used with its companion CLI tool, called in the same way, `bmbuilder`, or used as a library in other tools as for example in the bmqsim tool.
